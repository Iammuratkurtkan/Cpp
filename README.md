# Cpp
Hello to everyone. I'm Murat Kurtkan. This explanation is valid for my C ++ codes. I am working as a lecture at Bursa Technical University where I studied C ++ programming language. I am not currently a C ++ developer. But outside of my lesson, I try to improve myself as much as I can. So I'm a rookie .
